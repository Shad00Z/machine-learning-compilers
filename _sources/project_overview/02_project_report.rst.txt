Project Report
===============

In the first two weeks of our project, we focused on ARM AArch64 assembly to build a solid foundation for understanding machine learning compilers. During the first week, we examined the assembly output of a simple C program compiled with both **GCC** and **Clang** to explore the differences in code generation and function call conventions. 

This initial exploration helped us become familiar with compiler behavior, instruction-level representations, and low-level debugging tools such as **GDB**. 

Further details about the specific steps and tasks can be found in the :ref:`assembly section<Assembly>` of our project documentation.
