This project discusses the development of a **Machine Learning Compiler**. 
In other words, we explain how we developed a domain-specific, primitive-based tensor compiler.
If that sounds like a random string of technical buzzwords to you, don't worry. 
In the following sections, we will break down what a tensor compiler is, why it's useful, and how you can use our implementation.
